### üìò Notes for Chunk 2

#### üóÇÔ∏è Key Concepts & Topics:
Gaussian Elimination, Pivoting, Matrix Operations, Determinant Calculation,  Back Substitution, Augmented Matrices, Failure Cases in Elimination

#### üß† Key Takeaways:
- Gaussian elimination transforms a matrix A into an upper triangular matrix U.  This is a fundamental computation in scientific computing.
- Pivots in Gaussian elimination cannot be zero.  A zero in the pivot position necessitates row exchange to find a non-zero pivot.  Failure occurs when a zero pivot exists and no row exchange is possible.
- The determinant of a matrix is the product of its pivots.
- The augmented matrix includes the right-hand side vector (B) for solving systems of linear equations.  The operations performed on the coefficient matrix during elimination are simultaneously applied to the augmented column.
- Back substitution efficiently solves the resulting upper triangular system (UX = C) starting from the last equation.


#### üí¨ Important Quotes or Examples:
- "pivots can't be 0. I don't accept 0 as a pivot."
- Example of a matrix where failure could be avoided via row exchange.
- Example showing how a specific value in the matrix (e.g., -4 instead of 1) could lead to complete failure (no third pivot).
- "The determinant is 10." (Product of pivots)
- Explanation of the augmented matrix and its use in solving equations.


#### üìå Definitions / Terminology:
- **Pivot:**  A non-zero element used in Gaussian elimination to eliminate entries below it.
- **Upper Triangular Matrix (U):** A square matrix where all entries below the main diagonal are zero.
- **Augmented Matrix:** A matrix formed by appending the right-hand side vector to the coefficient matrix.

- Expressing Gaussian elimination with matrices:  A sequence of elementary matrix multiplications represents the elimination process.
